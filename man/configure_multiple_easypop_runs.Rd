\usage{
configure_multiple_easypop_runs(
  l.settings,
  s.starting.config.file,
  s.filebase,
  b.run = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{l.settings}{a list whose names are easypop config file parameter names,
and whose values are vectors of settings (values) for each parameter}

\item{s.starting.config.file}{names an easypop config file to be used as the basis
for the simulations, with revised settings as given by the first arg}

\item{s.filebase}{names the prefix used to name configuration files
(*.cfg) and output files (*equ, *gen, etc).  The program also adds an
integer to the file names that indicates its order of creation.}

\item{b.run}{optional, default = FALSE, if set to TRUE, as each config is created,
a simulation is run based on the config}
}
\description{
given a list of parameter names, each with a vector of values, for each
combination of settings, create an easypop configuration file
and, optionally run each file as it is created.  Configuration and output files
mames are numberd as created.  After all configurations are written (and, optionally, run),
the program also writes  a tabular file with the given filebase and with extension,
".config.key.tsv"  This table gives in it's first column a config file number, and in
columns 2..N, the values for the params that were in the l.settings list
(see parameter descriptions).
