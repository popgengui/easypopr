Description: easypopr provides a set of prompts at the R console that lets the user parameterize the EASYPOP simulation program.  It writes the parameter values to a configuration file.  The program can execute EASYPOP simulator directly after entering the parameters, or later using the configuration file.  The package also provides functions to read in an EASYPOP configuration file for adjusting parameter values, and then writing and rerunning with the new values.  Functions are also provided to plot the F-statistics and related quantities generated by the simulator.
